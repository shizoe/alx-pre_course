My first repo session readme file

Wow. Short for words. git and github are really awesome and the experience that I am having is super awesome and this is the best feeling ever. 
Will be practicing more to get the gist of it all.

Thanks ALX for introducing me to such awesome experiences.

Zoe my daughter is the inspiration for all of these. I want her to look at me and be happy of the man that I am, the father that she deserves
